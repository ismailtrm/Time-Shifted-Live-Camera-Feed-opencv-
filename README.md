# Camera Feed Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate different camera feed processing techniques using OpenCV. 

## Time-Shifted Live Camera Feed

This script captures video from your webcam and applies a time shift effect by delaying the display of frames.

### Code

```python
import cv2
import collections

# Start the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Cannot open camera!")
    exit()

# Get the camera FPS (frames per second)
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
delay_time = 3  # 3-second delay
buffer_size = int(fps * delay_time)

# Create a frame buffer with a max size corresponding to the delay
frame_buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=buffer_size)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # If the frame is not read correctly, exit the loop
    if not ret:
        print("Error: Cannot retrieve frame!")
        break

    # Add the current frame to the buffer
    frame_buffer.append(frame)

    # If the buffer is full, display the oldest frame to create a delay effect
    if len(frame_buffer) == buffer_size:
        cv2.imshow('Time-Shifted Live Camera', frame_buffer[0])
    else:
        # If the buffer is not full yet, show the current frame
        cv2.imshow('Time-Shifted Live Camera', frame)

    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
How It Works
Initialization: Starts the camera and initializes the frame buffer.
Frame Capture: Continuously captures frames from the camera.
Buffer Management: Stores frames in a buffer to create a delay effect.
Display: Shows the delayed frame when the buffer is full, otherwise shows the current frame.
Exit: Closes the camera and windows when 'q' is pressed.
Usage
Run the script using Python.
Adjust the delay_time variable to set the desired delay duration.
Press q to exit the application.

### Additional Tips

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Specify the language right after the opening triple backticks (e.g., `python` for Python code). This helps with syntax highlighting on platforms that support it, like GitHub.
- **Code Comments**: Use comments in the code to explain what each part does, as shown in the example above.
