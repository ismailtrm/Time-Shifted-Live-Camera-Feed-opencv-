To format code in a `README.md` file using Markdown, you use specific syntax for inline code and code blocks. Here’s a guide on how to format code for both inline snippets and larger code blocks:

### Inline Code

For inline code (short snippets within a sentence), wrap the code with single backticks (\`):

```markdown
To display the frame, use the `cv2.imshow()` function.
```

### Code Blocks

For larger code blocks, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to start and end the block. You can specify the language for syntax highlighting by adding it right after the opening backticks. 

Here’s an example of how you format different code blocks in Markdown:

```markdown
```python
import cv2
import collections

# Start the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Cannot open camera!")
    exit()
```
```

### Complete `README.md` Example

Below is a complete `README.md` file with properly formatted code blocks and explanations.

# Camera Feed Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate different camera feed processing techniques using OpenCV. 

## Time-Shifted Live Camera Feed

This script captures video from your webcam and applies a time shift effect by delaying the display of frames.

### Code

```python
import cv2
import collections

# Start the camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Check if the camera opened successfully
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Cannot open camera!")
    exit()

# Get the camera FPS (frames per second)
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
delay_time = 3  # 3-second delay
buffer_size = int(fps * delay_time)

# Create a frame buffer with a max size corresponding to the delay
frame_buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=buffer_size)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # If the frame is not read correctly, exit the loop
    if not ret:
        print("Error: Cannot retrieve frame!")
        break

    # Add the current frame to the buffer
    frame_buffer.append(frame)

    # If the buffer is full, display the oldest frame to create a delay effect
    if len(frame_buffer) == buffer_size:
        cv2.imshow('Time-Shifted Live Camera', frame_buffer[0])
    else:
        # If the buffer is not full yet, show the current frame
        cv2.imshow('Time-Shifted Live Camera', frame)

    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Starts the camera and initializes the frame buffer.
2. **Frame Capture**: Continuously captures frames from the camera.
3. **Buffer Management**: Stores frames in a buffer to create a delay effect.
4. **Display**: Shows the delayed frame when the buffer is full, otherwise shows the current frame.
5. **Exit**: Closes the camera and windows when 'q' is pressed.

### Usage

- Run the script using Python.
- Adjust the `delay_time` variable to set the desired delay duration.
- Press `q` to exit the application.
```
